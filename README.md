# reText
re:Text plans to utilize the permaweb to usher in a new era of publishing: decentralized.   Readers are only required to hold Arweave Tokens in their wallets to access published content from writers. The amount of tokens needed to be held by a reader to access content is governed by a system called "ink". Each published content will have its own ink rating where readers can spend tokens to vote and increase or decrease "ink". Writers will profit from every vote or donation made by readers. A small amount is also redistributed back to voters.  re:Text bridges the gap betwen readers and writers through a system where the community will be the deciding factor in a published content's success, in a system achievable only through blockchain and essentially, Arweave.
